# ABAQUS subroutines

After 15+ years of coding in ABAQUS, I decided to put up a public repository of the subroutines I am using as part of my research. These subroutines (in reality a small part of what is possible in ABAQUS) covers some aspects of material mechanics.
>While I took care of verifying my code (verification) they might not be bug free and you should use them in accordance. Furthermore, the proposed implementation are not necessarily validated (validation) in the sense that the chosen models are merely examples and their performance will be highly case dependent.
